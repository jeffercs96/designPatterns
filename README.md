## Description

Add a brief description of the project here.

## Factory Method

The Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to decide which class to instantiate. It encapsulates the object creation logic in a separate method, which subclasses can override to provide their own implementation.

The Factory Method pattern is useful when you want to delegate the responsibility of object creation to subclasses, allowing them to provide different implementations of the same interface. This promotes loose coupling and flexibility in your code.
